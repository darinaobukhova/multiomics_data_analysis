# Multiomics data analysis 

A personal collection or resources, focused on multi-omics data analysis. 

# Relevance 

In the recent years, a plethora of methods capturing multiple modalities, such as RNA expression, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance among others, from the same cell (hence, single-cell multi-omics) have been developed. Here I will collect papers, methods, tutorials and other things related to the single-cell omics.
