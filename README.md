# Multiomics data analysis 

A personal collection or resources, focused on multi-omics data analysis. 

# Relevance 

In the recent years, a plethora of methods capturing multiple modalities, such as RNA expression, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance among others, from the same cell (hence, single-cell multi-omics) have been developed. Here I will collect papers, methods, tutorials and other things related to the single-cell omics. 

# Review papers

## Methods' general overviews

- [A comprehensive review of single-cell multiomics methods and their use](https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799(20)30057-3) by Ma, A., McDermaid, A., Xu, J., Chang, Y., Ma, Q. This review discusses the application of existing single-cell multi-omics tools through two designed case studies and give a summary of current challenges and future perspectives. 
- [A comprehensive review of single-cell multiomics technology and data analysis methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-020-0420-2#citeas) by Lee, J., Hyeon, D.Y., Hwang, D., Contents-wise similar to the review above, this one also explains the part preceding multi-omics data analysis: cell isolation and barcoding. Moreover, it goes into more details in the double-modality analysis: transcriptome–genome, transcriptome–epigenome, transcriptome–proteome.
